            CLEAN CODE 

clean code is not about code that works , but is about the code which can be understand 
because a lot of time is spent to understand code and code should  be written in a way that is understandable 

so what is clean code - the code which is readable and understandable 
            should be consise and to the point
            should avoid complex nesting and big code block
            follow common best practices and pattern 


Clean code doesn't mean your code should be typed strongly, strict typing just ensure readability and more importantly error handling 

Clean code & Patterns and Principle goes hand to hand , Patterns & Principle help in writing clean code , and writing readable and maintainable code helps in clean code too

Always question your existing code & refactor it a lot , that's best way to implement clean code 



1st Key Point 
    - Names 

Rule - Name should be meaningful
Well -named "Things" allow reader to understand your code without goint through it in detail

Their is always more than one way to name something, our focus should be , our names shouldn't be bad/ not-readable 


Naming Variables & Constants
    - use nouns or short phrases with adjactive 
    Eg - userData, isVaild


Naming Functions/ Methods 
    - think of it as commands that need to be executed 
    - use verbs or short phrase with adjactive 
    Eg- sendData() , inputIsVaild()


Naming Classes 
    - Use to create "things" 
    - Use nouns
    Eg- class User {} ,class RequestBody {}


CASING 
    - sanke_case : python 
    - camelCase : java , javascript
    - PascalCase : py, java, js (ClassName ) 
    - kekbab-case : HTML


Value is Object  , naming - user, database
Value is Number/String , naming - name, age
Value is Boolean , naming - isActive, loggedIn


Naming Function & Methods 
    - Based on Operations, Eg- getUser()
    - if it returns a boolean Eg - isVaild()

Naming classes 
    -Describe the object 
    Eg- User, Customer

Inside the class when we write methods
    we have getters and setter methods like getClientId 
    and when we use it as a property then  we also name it like a property even though it is a function 
    like user.clientId()


Comments & Code Formating 

only add comments if you want to explicitly describe something
make your code written in such a way that it automatically described itself 


Code Formating - improves readability 
    -Vertical Formating 
    - Horizontal Formating

Formating rules differ between languages

Search - [language] style guide 
        Eg- javascript style guide

Vertical Formating
    - space between line 
    -  make same content , together -> like a function is calling another function, try to put that function after the function is called 


Horizontal Formating 
    -  space between code 
    - indentation
